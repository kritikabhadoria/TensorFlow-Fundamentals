    "In TensorFlow, several data structures are commonly used for storing and manipulating data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tensors**: Tensors are the primary data structure in TensorFlow, representing multi-dimensional arrays of data. Tensors can have different ranks (number of dimensions) and shapes. Examples include scalars (rank 0 tensors), vectors (rank 1 tensors), matrices (rank 2 tensors), and higher-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constants**: Constants are immutable tensors whose values cannot be changed during execution. They are created using the `tf.constant()` function and typically used for storing fixed values like hyperparameters or configuration settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variables**: Variables are mutable tensors whose values can be changed during execution using operations like assignment. They are created using the `tf.Variable()` constructor and are often used to represent model parameters that need to be optimized during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sparse Tensors**: Sparse tensors are a specialized form of tensors used to efficiently represent and manipulate sparse data, where most of the elements are zero. They consist of three components: indices, values, and dense_shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of TensorFlow Constants vs Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define TensorFlow constants\n",
    "const_a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "const_b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define TensorFlow variables\n",
    "var_a = tf.Variable([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "var_b = tf.Variable([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Constant values cannot be modified\n",
    "# const_a[0] = 7  # This will raise an error\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variables can be modified using TensorFlow operations\n",
    "var_a.assign([7, 8, 9])\n",

    "Matrix Addition, Multiplication, and Element-wise Operations in TensorFlow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix Addition**: Matrix addition in TensorFlow can be performed using the `tf.add()` function or the `+` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define matrices\n",
    "matrix_a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",

    "# Define matrices\n",

    "print(result_multiplication.numpy())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Element-wise Operations**: Element-wise operations in TensorFlow are performed directly on corresponding elements of tensors. Common element-wise operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
